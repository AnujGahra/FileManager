# CLI File Manager Application

## Overview

I created a **File Manager Application** based on the Command Line Interface (CLI) that provides various operations to manage files and folders seamlessly. This application simplifies basic file and folder management tasks directly from the terminal.

## Features

The application supports the following operations:

- **Create Folder**: Create a new folder in the specified directory.
- **Create File**: Create a new file within a directory.
- **Write to File**: Write or append data to an existing file.
- **Delete File**: Delete a specific file from a directory.
- **Delete Folder**: Remove a folder and its contents.
- **List Items**: Display all files and folders in the current directory.
- **Exit**: Safely exit the application.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cli-filemanager.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cli-filemanager
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   node filemanager.js
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform file or folder operations.

## Commands Overview

Here’s how the commands work:

1. **Create Folder**:  
   Input the name of the folder you want to create. If the folder already exists, it will notify you.

2. **Create File**:  
   Specify the file name and its directory. An empty file is created.

3. **Write to File**:  
   Add text to a file. If the file doesn’t exist, it will notify you.

4. **Delete File**:  
   Enter the file name to remove it from the directory.

5. **Delete Folder**:  
   Enter the folder name to delete the folder and its contents.

6. **List Items**:  
   Displays all files and folders in the current working directory.

7. **Exit**:  
   Close the application.
